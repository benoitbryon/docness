TODO
####

Consider the documentation as code. If it doesn't work or it isn't "finished",
it should not be committed. So avoid "maybe" or "todo" patterns in
documentation:

* if resolution is important, fix it now.
* if resolution can be postponed, create a ticket (bug or task), so that it can
  be prioritized. Then remove "todo" from documentation.

As an example, don't use `Sphinx's todo extension`_.
