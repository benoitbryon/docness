Keep straightforward
####################

Documentation has to be:

* simple to read and understand
* simple to create and maintain.

The best way to achieve this is to keep it minimal. So, make documentation
straightforward.

See also:

* :doc:`/be-directive`: focus on what has been proven functional.
* :doc:`channel-communication-flow`: redirect readers to external ressources.
